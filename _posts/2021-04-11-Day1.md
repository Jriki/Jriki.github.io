## Creating a blog website
I wasn't sure what kind of website I wanted to create. I was thinking to do from a scratch for a blog website, but it seemed it was complicated to make it with a free domain. After some research, I decided to use Github just because I thought it would be nice to learn Github at the same time.

Followed guides on the GitHub for Jekyll.  When I got an error while installing bundle for Ruby, this code helped me.

This is for Mac.
‘gem install -n /usr/local/bin jekyll’

Also few videos from this YouTube helped me a lot.

## Learning C++
Besides creating a website, I learned how to make a simple snake game with C++. It was great to learn some loop functions and libraries and so on.

Before C++, I learned how to code in Python and R mainly for a machine learning.
Currently, thinking what to make from a scratch. It should be fun and great to learn something new.
