## Update
It's been while from my last post. I have been working on projects including some C++ projects I uploaded on GitHub. I've been taking care of some personal things while studying, hence why  I haven’t touched my coding blog in a while.

Meantime I’ve made a simple Japanese Quiz App. Its aim is to help learn some Japanese words through an interactive quiz.

Since I was new to CPP, it took me a while to polish up the app. I did not want to create something that needed too many lines of code. I tried multiple methods/approaches to make the app. For example, I tried to use ‘vector’(which I originally found on stackoverflow or something similar) but it wasn’t functioning like I wanted. It wasn’t reacting well with the answers. Then I tried a read file method to get info (questions and answers) yet somehow did not work well. A simple version of reading or writing files somehow worked just fine in a previous project, but not on this app. Anyways, I ended up simply using an array to make it simple, which was pretty straight forward and fit the purpose of the app so I was happy with it.

Right after that I worked on the second app, a flight reservation app. What I learned from working on this app is that I could use a method in another method to act like a ripple effect to make them interact each other. I assume there is a simpler way to avoid having to create so many lines or multiple methods to perform the exact same function. I believe that will be my assignment in the future. Meantime, I was able to use ‘fstream’ for a text yet, come to think of it, this could have been better for the typing function.

I guess I still have a long ways to go, but hey, one step at a time, right?
